#Overview

This project integrates Google Generative AI (Gemini) with LangChain to provide an innovative solution for interacting with PDF documents.By utilizing Streamlit for the user interface, 
this application allows users to effortlessly upload PDF files and engage in a dynamic question-and-answer session based on the content of these documents. The platform extracts pertinent 
information from the PDFs and delivers accurate, contextually relevant responses to user queries.

At the core of this project is the Google Generative AI (Gemini), a powerful language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. This model processes user questions and
the content of the uploaded PDFs to provide detailed and precise answers. By leveraging LangChain, the project ensures that the information flow from the PDFs to the language model is seamless, 
allowing for effective extraction and interaction with the document's contents.

Overall, the "Chat with PDF using Gemini" project showcases the potential of combining advanced AI models with practical applications. It transforms static PDF documents into interactive resources, 
enabling users to efficiently extract and comprehend the information they need. This project exemplifies how AI can enhance the accessibility and usability of information stored in traditional document formats.
